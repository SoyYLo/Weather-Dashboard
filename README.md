# Weather-Dashboard

## User Story

As a developer
I WANT to create a webpage where users can search the weather outlook for different cities
So that they map plan their travels or stay up to date on the local weather for those cities.

## Description

Given the user loads the page
Then they will see a header with the name of the webpage "Weather Dashboard"
When they want to search for a city
Then they will see a search input on the left hand side of the page.
When user inputs desired city
Then the webpage will search given city using the weather API and it will return with information about the weather details about that city.
There are 2 displays on the right hand side of the page where the user can view todays weather and the 5 day forecast for that specific city
